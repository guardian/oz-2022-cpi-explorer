# Getting interactives to work with dark mode in apps 

If a user is viewing the Guardian app in "dark mode", by default, interactive atoms and chart atoms will get a white background applied to them. This makes sure that the default black text is visible on dark mode. 

However, a white background can look bad on some interactives. For interactives where design is more important, you may want to override the white background with a transparent or dark one and add specific CSS styles for dark mode. 

NB: This should work for pages rendered through the old app rendering platform. Currently any page with an interactive atom on it gets put through the old rendering platform.  


## Viewing dark mode on your computer

The background-color attribute is set behind a dark-mode media query so you will only see this in Inspector if you have set your browser or Macbook to dark mode. 

To do this on your Mac go to:

**System Preferences > General > Appearance > Dark**

The apps-rendering page should now be in dark-mode and you should be able to see that all atoms have the default white background. 

## Interactive templates: adding dark mode

Because atom content in interactive pages is unpacked and the html/css/js dropped directly into the html, you can use standard dark mode CSS. Just remember to limit it to apps-only classes so it doesn't show up on dotcom (dotcom currently doesn't support dark mode). As long as it is specific enough it should work [CONFIRM].

```CSS
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
         .android, .ios {  
                body {
                    background: #1A1A1A !important;
                } 
                h1, h2, p, span {
                    color: white;
                }
        }
}
```


## Article templates: Overriding the white background and adding dark mode

This is more complicated on article pages because atoms are iframed in - so it's harder for the content in the iframe to know that the parent is in dark mode. We need to use a JS trick to reach outside the iframe and find out the state of the parent. 

But first you have to do the CSS. Set the `background-color` of the `body` more forcibly than the app CSS. You will need to use something like:

```CSS
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
          /* see below for explanation of "in-app" class */
         .in-app {  
                body {
                    background: #1A1A1A !important;
                } 
                h1, h2, p, span {
                    color: white;
                }
        }
}

/* see below for explanation of this workaround for Android  */
.dark-mode-on.in-app {
       body {
            background: #1A1A1A !important;
        } 
        h1, h2, p, span {
            color: white;
        }
}
   
```

To avoid repetition you can use a SCSS mixin to wrap all the styles together like [here](https://github.com/guardian/interactive-covid-uk-tracker/blob/master/shared/css/_darkmodedefault.scss). Annoyingly the Android app doesn't currently recognise the dark-mode media query, so we have to use this workaround involving a classname `dark-mode-on`.

You can add a class or id to the body if you need to make the CSS more specific.

Importantly, you want to make sure this applies only on apps. Macbooks can have dark mode but until dotcom implements dark mode, we only want dark mode styles to appear in apps. This is why we need the `in-app` class name. To do that: 

Add some code like this to your `app.js` file. And wrap all your dark mode code above in an `.in-app { }` selector. This means it will only apply when the atom is embedded in an app article page. 



```JS
const checkApp = () => {

  // eg AMP pages this is not present so just return. Dark mode can't work on iframed atoms in AMP
  if(!window.parent) {
    return; 
  }

  // check the parent window to see if this atom is embedded in an app
  const parentIsIos = window.parent.document.querySelector(".ios") // null if not present
  const parentIsAndroid = window.parent.document.querySelector(".android")
  
  // if it is in an app, add the 'in-app' class name to the body
  if(parentIsIos || parentIsAndroid){ document.querySelector("body").classList.add("in-app") }
  
  // hack for android app - it also needs this for an annoying reason 
  const parentIsInDarkMode = window.parent.document.querySelector(".dark-mode-on")
  if(parentIsInDarkMode) { document.querySelector("body").classList.add("dark-mode-on") }
}


checkApp()
```



## If apps-rendering ever does pages with interactive atoms

The new Apps-Rendering platform CSS reaches into the iframe that hosts the interactive and sets the `background-color` of the `body` to white. [Code here](https://github.com/guardian/apps-rendering/blob/2436d412831ff14a0709b1813fd0421c95eb3663/src/components/atoms/interactiveAtom.tsx#L37).

You can view this in action by opening a published page in your computer browser in the apps-rendering view: 

**Guardian article > Teleporter > apps-rendering**

Inspect the body element of the iframe that hosts your interactive. 

Old apps-rendering [sets the white background here](https://github.com/guardian/mobile-apps-article-templates/blob/master/ArticleTemplates/assets/scss/themes/darkMode/_darkModeShared.scss).
